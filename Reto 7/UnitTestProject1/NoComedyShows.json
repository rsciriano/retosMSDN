Roosevelt.\n\nThe search had gone dormant, but now, Rick and Marty Lagina, two brothers from Michigan, have bought most of the island and have renewed the efforts to discover the legendary treasure. Since childhood, Oak Island has been a magical place of intrigue for these men. With Marty’s financial backing, Rick is now leading the adventure of his life. But will their luck be any different from the many explorers who sought treasure before them and failed?\n\nThe Laginas insist that their goal is the fun of a treasure-hunting adventure, and if it becomes something that could splinter their brotherly bond, they’ll walk away.  But obsession has been known to grip treasure seekers on Oak Island.\n\nMany men have taken on the hunt with the best of intentions, only to be left with decimated fortunes, broken spirits and lost lives.

Sadly, thousands of these unsuspecting homeowners instead become victims, duped and abandoned by the contractors they trusted their savings to and left with either unfinished or danger-laden, uninhabitable homes due to poor craftsmanship. Host and master carpenter Adam Carolla and his team, consisting of no-nonsense, expert contractor Skip Bedell and his wife, private investigator Alison Bedell, are on a mission to track down these shady, evasive contractors and drag them back to the scene of the crime to face the music and fix the disasters they left behind. Eleven half-hour episodes of \"Catch A Contractor\" debut starting Sunday, March 9 at 10PM ET/PT with two back-to-back new episodes on Spike TV. Home improvement scams have consistently ranked in the Better Business Bureau's top 10 consumer cons. Carolla, who spent 10 years working in construction before his successful career in radio and television, takes this issue very personally. As a passionate master carpenter who has built hundreds of homes including his own, he not only has a keen eye when it comes to identifying shoddy, inferior work, but loathes seeing trusting and naïve average citizens getting scammed by subpar contractors and left holding the proverbial bag.","runtime":60,"status":"Continuing","network":"Spike TV","air_day":"Sunday","air_time":"10:00pm","certification":"","imdb_id":"tt3108438","tvdb_id":"279033","tvrage_id":"37007","poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/32902.jpg","images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/32902.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/32902.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/32902.jpg"},"watchers":1,"ratings":{"percentage":68,"votes":10,"loved":7,"hated":3},"genres":["Reality"]},{"title":"Drugs, Inc.","year":2010,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/drugs-inc","first_aired":1289113200,"country":"United States","overview":"How does the drug trade work?

Though many critics thought that Chicago Hope had a better chance for survival than ER, the NBC series scored a surprise hit -- and over a decade later it was still firmly imbedded in the network's Thursday-night schedule, while Chicago Hope had long since vanished. Set largely in the emergency room of Chicago's fictional County General Hospital, ER focused on the professional and personal trials and tribulations of the unit's staff, with several subplots and story arcs weaving in and out of each hour-long episode. The regular cast for the first season consisted of Anthony Edwards as Dr. Mark Greene, George Clooney as Dr. Doug Ross, Sherry Stringfield as Dr. Susan Lewis, Eriq La Salle as Dr. Peter Benton, Julianna Margulies as Head Nurse Carol Hathaway, and Noah Wyle as med student (and later doctor) John Carter. Of these actors, only Sherry Stringfield and Noah Wyle would still be on the series as it entered its second decade on the air -- and of these two, only Wyle had been on the show throughout its entire run (Stringfield retired from the series in season three, but returned five years later).\n\nLater principals, in order of their appearance, included Laura Innes as Dr. Kerry Weaver, Alex Kingston as Dr. Elizabeth Corday, Paul McCrane as Dr. Robert Romano, Kellie Martin as med student Lucy Knight, Erik Palladino as Dr. Dave Malucci, Goran Visnjic as Dr. Luka Kovac, Ming-Na as Dr. Jing-Mei \"Deb\" Chen (a recurring character in season one who returned as a regular in season six), Maura Tierney as Nurse (and later Dr.) Abby Lockhart, Michael Michele as Dr. Cleo Finch, Sharif Atkins as Dr. Michael Gallant, Mekhi Phifer as Dr. Gregory Pratt, and Parminder Nagra as med student (and later doctor) Neela Rasgotra. Many of these characters' lives were intertwined romantically, while some of the characters were bitter enemies; all were uniformly fascinating. And just as in \"real life,\" there was nothing predictable about the exits of certain characters: some departed with tragic abruptness (Lucy Knight, Robert Romano), others simply bade farewell and moved on with their lives (Doug Ross, Carol Hathaway, Peter Benton); but no \"goodbye\" was as poignant and moving as the lingering illness and death of Mark Greene throughout the length and breadth of season eight. Though the plot emphasis was on the continuing characters, a number of prominent guest stars made memorable appearances during the series' decade-plus run. Alan Alda, Sally Field, and Bob Newhart were but three of the A-list entertainers who passed in and out of the doors of Chicago County. The winner of innumerable industry awards, ER has also earned a niche in media history as the most expensive dramatic series in TV history, reaching this particular plateau with its 13-million-dollar-per-episode average budget during the 1998-1999 season.

Alfred Pongratz died in 1977 and so Gustl Bayrhammer got the role. In 1979, the Bayerischer Rundfunk decided to put \"Pumuckl\" on TV. The TV series was absolutely successful and is still continued even today even though Gustl Bayrhammer (Meister Eder) died several years ago. Today, Pumuckl is living on a ship that travels the river Danube, and his new friend, a crewman on that ship, is played by Towje Kleiner.
